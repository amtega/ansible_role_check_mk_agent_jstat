# Ansible check_mk_agent_steal_time role

This is an [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com) role to install Check_MK plugin to check heap and perm/meta memory size usage by a java process.

## Role Variables

A list of all the default variables for this role is available in `defaults/main.yml`.

## Usage

This is an example playbook:

```yaml
---

- hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: amtega.check_mk_agent_jstat
```

## Testing

Tests are based on [molecule with docker containers](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

To run test you need provide the variables defined in `defaults/main.yml`. One way to provide this information is calling the testing playbook passing an additional inventory using the following environment variables:

- `ANSIBLE_INVENTORY`: path to an inventory
- `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE`: path to the file containing the vault password required for the previous inventory


```shell
cd amtega.check_mk_agent_jstat

ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=~/myinventory ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=~/myvaultpassword molecule test --all
```
